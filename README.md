CRUD Product Management System
ðŸš€ Project Overview:
I have developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Product Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application allows users to manage product information efficiently.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Add New Products: Users can input product details such as title, price, tax percentage, discount, advertisement costs, count, and category.
Calculate Total: The system dynamically calculates the total cost considering tax, discount, and advertisement costs.
Product List Management: Displays a comprehensive list of products with options to update or delete entries.
ðŸ’» Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web page content.
CSS: For styling the user interface, ensuring a clean and user-friendly design.
JavaScript: For handling dynamic functionalities like form validation, total cost calculation, and CRUD operations.
ðŸ“ˆ User Interface:
The interface is designed to be intuitive with a dark theme and clearly labeled input fields and buttons, making it easy for users to navigate and manage products.
